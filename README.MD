# 5-Year Mastery Plans

A comprehensive guide for achieving mastery across multiple disciplines through structured, strategic learning paths.

## Overview

This repository contains detailed 5-year plans for achieving high-level proficiency across several skill clusters:

1. Technical/Engineering
2. Global/Cultural
3. Physical Excellence
4. Professional/Technical Development
5. Creative/Artistic
6. Personal Development

Each cluster is designed to build compounding knowledge while creating meaningful societal impact.

## Skill Clusters

### 1. Technical/Engineering Cluster

- International properties
- Cultural understanding

### 3. Physical Excellence Cluster
- Boxing
- Karate
- Running
- Nutrition knowledge
- Sports science

### 4. Professional/Technical Cluster
- MIT CS knowledge
- Stock broker knowledge
- Typing speed (200 WPM)

### 5. Creative/Artistic Cluster
- Professional guitar
- Culinary arts
- Penmanship
- Public speaking

### 6. Personal Development Cluster

## Structure

Each cluster's 5-year plan includes:

1. Year-by-year progression
2. Monthly breakdowns
3. Weekly goals
4. Daily schedules
5. Progress tracking systems
6. Obstacle management strategies

## Implementation Strategy

### Primary Focus Selection

- Provides balance
- Creates synergistic effects

## Tracking Progress

Each plan includes:
- Monthly milestones
- Weekly checkpoints
- Daily progress metrics
- Periodic assessments
- Adjustment protocols
